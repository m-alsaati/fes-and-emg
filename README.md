# Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) and Electromyography (EMG)

FES uses short electrical impulses to artificially generate muscle contractions in a specific region of the body. This method is especially useful in therapy situations which involve retraining muscles which have greatly reduced or lost function.

In order to observe the Force-EMG relationship, the force and EMG signals were divided into the 10 separate muscle contraction events, then the average force and RMS value of the EMG for each section was calculated. Then, the RMS values were plotted against the average force for each segment as seen in figure 6, and the Force-EMG relationship can be seen to approximately be a linear relationship.
