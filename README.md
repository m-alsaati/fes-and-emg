# Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) and Electromyography (EMG)

FES uses short electrical impulses to artificially generate muscle contractions in a specific region of the body. This method is especially useful in therapy situations which involve retraining muscles which have greatly reduced or lost function.

In order to observe the Force-EMG relationship, the force and EMG signals were divided into the 10 separate muscle contraction events, then the average force and RMS value of the EMG for each section was calculated. Then, the RMS values were plotted against the average force for each segment as seen in figure 6, and the Force-EMG relationship can be seen to approximately be a linear relationship.

### Muscle Fatigue

In order to determine which stimulation frequency causes faster muscle fatigue, the muscle contraction force 20, 40 and 60 newtons were compared. By comparing the values, it can be seen that the effect of muscle fatigue due to higher stimulation frequencies occurs very early at around 20 seconds into the trial. The difference between muscle contraction force in the 30Hz trial and 60Hz trial is roughly 0.65N. This difference increases drastically as the trial continues as seen at the 40 second mark where the difference becomes 1.85N. This difference remains the same at the 60 second mark as well. This concludes the theory that a symptom of increasing muscle stimulation frequency is the increased rate of muscle fatigue.

### Force Output and Stimulation Amplitude

These plots show the realtionship between the electrical stimulation and force output by the muscles as a result of the amount of electrical stimulation and clearly shows that an increasing amount of electrical stimulation leads to larger force output by the muscles.
